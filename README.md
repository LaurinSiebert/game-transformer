Dungeon Crawl LLM

# the reason
This is my first trial project to work on LLMs. To begin with I'll use Hugging Face to access GPT-2 but longterm I want to train my own model.

# the concept
It's a dungeon crawler in a Chatbot. It should feel like a conversation based DnD game. I'm not entirely sure where this is heading but it'll start this way and then I'll add some features like
map creation, character files, saving states..
